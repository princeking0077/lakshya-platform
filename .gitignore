# Wait, we WANT server/client_build to be committed IF we want Hostinger to use it without building.
# If Hostinger runs "npm install" in server directory, it won't build frontend unless we have a script.
# User asked to "push to github" for "server of hostinger".
# If I exclude it, Hostinger won't have the UI.
# So I should UN-IGNORE it or NOT ignore it.
# The previous lines ignored `out/` and `build/`.
# `client/out` is ignored.
# `server/client_build` contains the production assets.
# I will NOT ignore server/client_build.
